Tiny Calculator was created with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn`
Fetchs npm dependencies packages into node_modules of project

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

If encounters message on Terminal like: You can now view tiny-calculator in the browser [http://x86_64-apple-darwin13.4.0:3000](http://x86_64-apple-darwin13.4.0:3000 ). And it doesn't automatically navigate to browser on port 3000, so you need run command `unset HOST` to fix before running `yarn start`.<br />

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
